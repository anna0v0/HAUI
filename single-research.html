                Timely and effective communication is absolutely crucial in healthcare. So making sure the technologies that support healthcare communication are working optimally is a key task for CIOs and other health IT workers.

                Physicians and nurses must be connected at all times. Health systems must be able to link to all the various provider organizations that make up the delivery system. And clinical and business leaders must be able to efficiently converse with their teams, large and small. Here, four experts from healthcare communications technology companies offer best practices for optimizing these technologies to work most effectively within CIOs’ and other health IT leaders’ provider organizations.
                                        
                More than 90% of hospitals will purchase smartphones in the next two years; however, less than 78% of them have a solid mobile communication strategy, according to Spyglass Consulting Group. To integrate smart technologies into the clinical environment requires that patient-to-caregiver communication tools are optimized for performance, reliability and flexibility. “One of the most important things a hospital can do to optimize their communication technology is to perform a current state analysis,” said Kourtney Govro, vice president, business development, at Critical Alert Systems.
                    
                “This involves documenting their alarm notification technology workflow,” she said. “Using visuals, like flowcharts, will allow all stakeholders to understand how clinical workflow occurs and who within the care team performs each step. It seems like a very simple thing to do, but we often find it has not been done.”
                    
                There can be questions about how a system is supposed to work versus how it does work. Oftentimes, with nurse call deployments, hospitals resort to “chasing lights” when they could be leveraging much more than just the basic signaling technology, Govro added.
                    
                “Examples include integrations with EHRs, smart beds, RTLS and more,” she said. “This would enable and empower the care team to engage more naturally with their patients, and each other, using the data from smart technologies.”
